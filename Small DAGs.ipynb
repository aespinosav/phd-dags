    "\n",
    "Since we want simple structures where the behaviour of the network might be *strange*, we will be looking to understand the traffic assingment in detail, hence only a single OD pair will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get down to the simple structures, we will be looking at DAGs with a partial ordering induced by the origin and destination nodes. The ordering is the natural one in the sense that $b > a$ if node $b$ is downstream from $a$. We will call the origin node $O$ and the destination node $D$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are looking for networks that fulfill the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. All nodes ($n_i \\in \\mathcal{N}$) must satisfy,\n",
    "    * $n_i > O$,\n",
    "    * $n_i < D$\n",
    "      \n",
    " 2. The graph is acyclic.\n",
    " \n",
    "These conditions impose two important restrictions on the adjacency matrix of the networks we are looking for. The first is that the adjacency matrix $\\mathsf{A}$ of the network must be upper triangular (or it should be possible to relabel the nodes so that it is). Naturally the first node is the $O$, and the last one is $D$, so we are imposing that $O$ must be the least node in the graph and $D$ must be the greatest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the fact that all the nodes must be comparable to both the origin and the destination means that the remaining two nodes must have both in-degree and out-degree of at least 1. Which means that there cannot be any rows or columns in the matrix (except the first column and the last row) whose elements are all $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also able to order the remaining two nodes in the following way. Since all nodes need to be downstream of $O$ that guarantees that at least one of them will have an incoming edge that is adjacent to $O$. So WLOG we can label that node as the second node. The third node must therefore have an outgoing edge that is incident to $D$.\n",

    "Where the squares are either $0$ or $1$. So there are four possible combinations for the first row, and there are only three possible combinations for the second row since the row cannot have all zeroes. In addition, out of the 12 different graphs, two of those result in an all-zero column, $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(1,0,1)$ with $(0,1)$. Which leaves us with 10 different possible graphs."
